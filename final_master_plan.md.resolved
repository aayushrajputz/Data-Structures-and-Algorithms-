# The "Titan" Master Plan: Road to 25 LPA + Founding Engineer

## Phase 1: The Foundation (January 2026)
- **Goal**: Complete Striver SDE Sheet (Day 7 - Day 26).
- **Core Focus**: Master the patterns (Greedy, Recursion, Trees, Graphs, DP).
- **Execution**: Daily consistency, no-nonsense "Beast Mode" ghisayi.
- **Milestone**: 180+ Problems solved and visualized.

## Phase 2: Architect & Revision (February - March 2026)
- **Focus**: Pure LLD and DSA Mastery. No HLD yet.
- **LLD (Low-Level Design) Mastery**: 
    - Start from pure basics (Interfaces, SOLID).
    - Design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Observer, etc.).
    - Famous Case Studies (Parking Lot, BookMyShow, Uber) from scratch.
    - **Language**: TypeScript (Learned in 1-2 days parallelly).
- **Striver Revision (2nd Pass)**: 
    - Re-solve the sheet to cement patterns.
    - Focus on speed and optimization.
    - Simultaneous with LLD start.

## Phase 3: High-Scale Systems (April 2026 Onwards)
- **Goal**: Transition from Architect to System Designer.
- **HLD (High-Level Design)**: 
    - Start from absolute basics of HLD.
    - Advanced architectures (Uber, WhatsApp, Netflix).
    - Database Schema Design, Caching, Load Balancing, CDN.
    - **Language**: Go internals (Goroutines, Channels, Mutex).
- **Backend Powerhouse**: 
    - Scaling BinaryPDF (Caching, Queues, PostgreSQL Optimization).

## Professional Identity
- **Builder Mindset**: AI as an assistant, logic as the master.
- **Grit**: The surgery report is the proof of character. 
- **The Goal**: Not just an SDE-1, but a **Founding Engineer** at a top-tier PBC.
