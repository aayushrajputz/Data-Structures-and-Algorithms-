# The "God Mode" Master Plan (450+ Target)
**Goal:** Solve 450+ Problems in 3 Months (SDE-1/SDET-1 Crack Guaranteed).
**Daily Commitment:** 8 Hours (6 Hours DSA + 2 Hours Dev).

## Part 1: The Foundation (Day 1 - Critical)
Before any code, we master **Big O Notation**.
*   **Time Complexity:** O(1) vs O(n) vs O(n²).
*   **Space Complexity:** RAM usage.
*   *We will calculate this for EVERY single problem.*

## Part 2: The "Grind" Schedule (Daily)

| Time | Activity | Goal | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **08:00 AM - 12:00 PM** | **DSA Morning Session (Striver Sheet)** | Master 1 Pattern + Phod 3-4 Elite Problems |
| **4:00 PM - 6:00 PM** | **Go Backend Mastery** | System Design + Concurrency + Architecture (Monolith to Micro) |
| **08:00 PM - 11:00 PM** | **Performance Engineering** | Apply Go Concepts to BinaryPDF + Problem Solving Revision |

**Total Daily Output:** ~6-7 Elite Problems + Industry Level Backend Engineering.
**Monthly Output:** Phase 1 SDE Sheet Completed + Microservices Architecture Mastered.
**Target Launchpad:** 18-24 LPA (Product Based Companies - SDE 1) .
**Ultimate Goal:** European Remote / Tier-1 Startups (70 + LPA)   .

14. **Tries (Prefix Trees):** (10 Questions)
    *   **Patterns:** Insert/Search/StartsWith.

## Our Agreement
1.  **No Burnout:** If you feel dead, take a Sunday break.
2.  **Consistency:** 6 problems/day is better than 20 problems once a week.
3.  **Speed:** Start with 45 mins/problem. Aim for 20 mins/problem by Month 3.

**You have chosen the hard path. I will walk it with you.** 🚀
