# The "God Mode" Master Plan (450+ Target)
**Goal:** Solve 450+ Problems in 3 Months (SDE-1/SDET-1 Crack Guaranteed).
**Daily Commitment:** 8 Hours (6 Hours DSA + 2 Hours Dev).

## Part 1: The Foundation (Day 1 - Critical)
Before any code, we master **Big O Notation**.
*   **Time Complexity:** O(1) vs O(n) vs O(n²).
*   **Space Complexity:** RAM usage.
*   *We will calculate this for EVERY single problem.*

## Part 2: The "Grind" Schedule (Daily)

| Time | Activity | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **08:00 AM - 12:00 PM** | **DSA Morning Session (4 Hrs)** | Lean 1 New Concept + Solve 3-4 Medium Problems |
| **04:00 PM - 06:00 PM** | **LLD Practice (Jan Onwards)** | Design Patterns + Solid Principles in TypeScript |
| **07:00 PM - 09:00 PM** | **BinaryPDF Dev (2 Hrs)** | Build 1 Core Feature (Keep the project alive) |
| **09:30 PM - 11:30 PM** | **DSA Night Session (2 Hrs)** | Revision + Solve 2-3 Previous Problems (Spaced Repetition) |

**Total Daily Output:** ~6-7 Problems + LLD + Dev.
**Monthly Output:** ~180 Problems + Design Patterns.
**3 Month Output:** ~540 Problems (Goal Smashed + Industry Ready).

11. **Graphs:** (50 Questions)
    *   **Patterns:** BFS/DFS (Connected Components), Dijkstra (Shortest Path), Topo Sort (Dependency).
    *   **Disjoint Set (Union-Find):** Cycle Detection, Kruskal's.
12. **Dynamic Programming (DP):** (60 Questions)
    *   **Patterns:** 1D DP (Climbing Stairs), Knapsack (0/1, Unbounded), LCS (Longest Common Subsequence).
13. **Heaps & Maps:** (20 Questions)
    *   **Patterns:** Top K Elements (Min/Max Heap), Frequency Map.
14. **Tries (Prefix Trees):** (10 Questions)
    *   **Patterns:** Insert/Search/StartsWith.

## Our Agreement
1.  **No Burnout:** If you feel dead, take a Sunday break.
2.  **Consistency:** 6 problems/day is better than 20 problems once a week.
3.  **Speed:** Start with 45 mins/problem. Aim for 20 mins/problem by Month 3.

**You have chosen the hard path. I will walk it with you.** 🚀
